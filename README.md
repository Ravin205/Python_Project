Mini Project using Python
I have made project using Pyhton,
My first Project is based on Water,Snake,Gun game where a Player can choose any one from water,snake,gun and computer choose any one from water,snake,or gun
Second project name is "The Perfect Guess" where user can guess a value between 1 to 100. When user guess a smaller value than the correct value then program
displays the message "Enter a larger Number", when user's guess will be greater number then program displays "Enter the smaller Number" and when user will 
guess the right number, program displays the "right value" and also displays the number of guesses used by user to arrive at correct number. Third Project is all about Desktop Assistant .In this project user can get a different task from computer like open Google,Youtube,Stackoverflow,Wikipedia,Play Music,Open Your VS code, Sent Email. User give a command to  the Desktop Assistant for task which are given and computer do the task which one user wants.
